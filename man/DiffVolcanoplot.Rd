\title{Title Differential expressed genes volcano plot}
\usage{
DiffVolcanoplot(
  DiffGenes = DiffGenes,
  Location = c("Mal", "Bdy", "nMal"),
  cut_off_pvalue = 2,
  cut_off_logFC = 0.25,
  n = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DiffGenes}{A list of data frame contain differential expressed genes, p value, log2FC and adjusted p value in Mal, Bdy and nMal spots}

\item{Location}{Name in location defined ST data (Mal, Bdy, and nMal)}

\item{cut_off_pvalue}{Cut off of p value, features p value < 10^(-cut_off_pvalue) will be selected as significant}

\item{cut_off_logFC}{Cut off of log2FC, features log2FC > cut_off_logFC will be selected as significant}

\item{n}{Number of features labeled in volcano plot, default is 10}
}
\value{
A ggplot object
}
\description{
Draw a volcano plot of features in boundary defined ST data
}
