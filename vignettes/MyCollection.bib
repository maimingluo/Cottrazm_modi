abstract = {Spatial Transcriptomics is an emerging technology that adds spatial dimensionality and tissue morphology to the genome-wide transcriptional profile of cells in an undissociated tissue. Integrating these three types of data creates a vast potential for deciphering novel biology of cell types in their native morphological context. Here we developed innovative integrative analysis approaches to utilise all three data types to first find cell types, then reconstruct cell type evolution within a tissue, and search for tissue regions with high cell-to-cell interactions. First, for normalisation of gene expression, we compute a distance measure using morphological similarity and neighbourhood smoothing. The normalised data is then used to find clusters that represent transcriptional profiles of specific cell types and cellular phenotypes. Clusters are further sub-clustered if cells are spatially separated. Analysing anatomical regions in three mouse brain sections and 12 human brain datasets, we found the spatial clustering method more accurate and sensitive than other methods. Second, we introduce a method to calculate transcriptional states by pseudo-space-time (PST) distance. PST distance is a function of physical distance (spatial distance) and gene expression distance (pseudotime distance) to estimate the pairwise similarity between transcriptional profiles among cells within a tissue. We reconstruct spatial transition gradients within and between cell types that are connected locally within a cluster, or globally between clusters, by a directed minimum spanning tree optimisation approach for PST distance. The PST algorithm could model spatial transition from non-invasive to invasive cells within a breast cancer dataset. Third, we utilise spatial information and gene expression profiles to identify locations in the tissue where there is both high ligand-receptor interaction activity and diverse cell type co-localisation. These tissue locations are predicted to be hotspots where cell-cell interactions are more likely to occur. We detected tissue regions and ligand-receptor pairs significantly enriched compared to background distribution across breast cancer tissue. Together, these three algorithms, implemented in a comprehensive Python software stLearn, allow for the elucidation of biological processes within healthy and diseased tissues.

abstract = {Recent development of spatial transcriptomic technologies has made it possible to characterize cellular heterogeneity with spatial information. However, the technology often does not have sufficient resolution to distinguish neighboring cell types. Here, we present spatialDWLS, to quantitatively estimate the cell-type composition at each spatial location. We benchmark the performance of spatialDWLS by comparing it with a number of existing deconvolution methods and find that spatialDWLS outperforms the other methods in terms of accuracy and speed. By applying spatialDWLS to a human developmental heart dataset, we observe striking spatial temporal changes of cell-type composition during development.},

abstract = {To explore the distinct genotypic and phenotypic states of melanoma tumors, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to 4645 single cells isolated from 19 patients, profiling malignant, immune, stromal, and endothelial cells. Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to Tcell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies.},
